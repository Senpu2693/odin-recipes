    <h1>Kentucky Fried Chicken</h1>
    <img src="kfcBucket.png">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>KFC's original product is pressure-fried chicken pieces, 
        seasoned with Sanders' signature recipe of "11 herbs and 
        spices". The constituents of the recipe are a trade 
        secret. Larger portions of fried chicken are served in a 
        cardboard "bucket", which has become a feature of the 
        chain since it was first introduced by franchisee Pete 
        Harman in 1957. Since the early 1990s, KFC has expanded 
        its menu to offer other chicken products such as chicken 
        fillet sandwiches and wraps, as well as salads and side 
        dishes such as French fries and coleslaw, desserts and 
        soft drinks; the latter often supplied by PepsiCo. KFC 
        is known for its slogans "It's Finger Lickin' Good!", 
        "Nobody does chicken like KFC", "We do chicken right", 
        and "So good".</p>
